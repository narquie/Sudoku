# Sudoku
The point of this program is to solve the Sudoku puzzle inputted at the end of the code.
The string at the bottom "diag_sudoku_grid" is read as a Sudoku board, from left to right, top to bottom.

I added code to implement the naked_twins function which eliminates all numbers in a row or column or diagonal that has two boxes with the same two values... which means that no other box can have those two values in its row,column, or diagonal.

I also added the diagonal_units which allows for the sudoku puzzle to be solved diagonally.

All the rest of the code was provided by Udacity in their AI Nanodegree course.
